# supermarket-management

This is very basic level project of some concepts like LinkedList in Data structure and Algorithms(DSA). It is a mini project me and my team members made on the topic Supermarket Management System for Sem3. We are studying BE in Information Technology. 

Language used -> C

Data Structures used -> Linked List and Structure of Arrays

The user can select their role from Admin and Customer and according to their choice the respective functionalities can be accessed. 

We are open to suggestions on how to improve the program and also would love some insights to correct some of the problems in our code.

Hopefully this is helpful for other students as well!
