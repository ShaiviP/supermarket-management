# supermarket-management
This is a mini project me and my team members made on the topic Supermarket Management System, which can support 2 users, admin and customer, and they each have their own functions. 
Language used -> C
Data Structures used -> Linked List and Structure of Arrays
Hopefully this is helpful for other students as well!
